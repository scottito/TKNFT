# TKNFT
This is the code that builds the front end of the TimeKeeper's candy machine.
To build the web app for yourself clone the repo and run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
After that I have already input all of the necessary configurations so you can run `yarn start` to connect to the candy machine on your localHost.
To get a deployable program run  `yarn build` and a build file will be automatically generated in the main directory ready for deployment
